Hello netlanders,

Due to a project I'm working on (in minix), I'm interested in the posix
standard definition. Could somebody please point me to a (preferably)
machine-readable format of the latest posix rules? Ftp-sites would be
nice.

As an aside for all using gcc on minix - the new version (1.40) has been
out for some weeks, and I decided to test what needed to be done to get
it working on minix (1.37.1, which is the version you can get from
plains is nice, but 1.40 is better :-). To my surpice, the answer
turned out to be - NOTHING! Gcc-1.40 compiles as-is on minix386 (with
old gcc-1.37.1), with no need to change source files (I changed the
Makefile and some paths, but that's it!). As default this results in a
compiler that uses floating point insns, but if you'd rather not,
changing 'toplev.c' to define DEFAULT_TARGET from 1 to 0 (this is from
memory - I'm not at my minix-box) will handle that too. Don't make the
libs, use the old gnulib&libc.a. I have successfully compiled 1.40 with
itself, and everything works fine (I got the newest versions of gas and
binutils at the same time, as I've heard of bugs with older versions of
ld.c). Makefile needs some chmem's (and gcc2minix if you're still using
it).

PS. Could someone please try to finger me from overseas, as I've
installed a "changing .plan" (made by your's truly), and I'm not certain
it works from outside? It should report a new .plan every time.
